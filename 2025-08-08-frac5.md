# Frac5: A new type of flame fractal

![example frac5 fractal image](/images/fractal255.png)

This article describes my journey from generating flame fractals using
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang), to generating a new type of
(flame-ish?) fractal in [Numerical
Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-nx).  The code is published as a GPL
Elixir library at
[github.com/KeithFrost/frac5](https://github.com/KeithFrost/frac5).


This summer I've been working on personal projects at the [Recurse
Center](https://recurse.com) (RC).  Part of the RC application process
involves pitching at least one project that you plan to work on.  The
[frac5](https://github.com/KeithFrost/frac5) project was inspired by
the pitch I wrote for my RC application.

To give due credit, the work I describe here would not exist without
Danielle Navarro's terrific article [Art from code V: Iterated
function
systems](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2024-12-22_art-from-code-5/)
(hereinafter referred to as *AFC5*);
I'm going to summarize only those parts of their article which I used
for my starting point, but I encourage you to read the whole thing for
further inspiration.

I had been using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang) for personal projects
for a while, because I find programming with it elegant and fun; I
especially enjoy prototyping code using [Elixir
Livebook](https://livebook.dev) running locally.  I had read about
[Numerical Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-nx), which extends the
language to make it possible to perform the kind of efficient
numerical programming often done with [NumPy](https://numpy.org),
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), or similar libraries, but I had not
found a use case to motivate learning how to program it myself.  I
came across
[*AFC5*](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2024-12-22_art-from-code-5/),
enjoyed the beautiful images they were able to generate (especially
those at the end of the article), and was a little uncomfortable about
needing to resort to writing C++ to generate those detailed images
quickly.  My initial plan was to retrace their steps using only
Elixir, and then explore if there was some way to use Numerical Elixir
to accelerate the image generation.


## Iterated function systems

I will now briefly recap how the beautiful images at the end of *AFC5*
are generated, although if you want to reproduce all the details from
that article precisely, you should of course refer to it, and the code
it provides, directly.
